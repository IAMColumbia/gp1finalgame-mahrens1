Battle Stars

Battle Stars is a classic clicker game where you fight monsters to earn money and xp. 
Money can be used to buy new weapons and certain upgrades. Xp is mainly used for certain upgrades. 
Monster will change when while you fight them and it is important to hit their weak points to do damage.

Developer Log:

Player Script
--------------
The player script uses the singleton design pattern to make it accessable
to all other scripts. This creates the problem that it can be changed anywhere
which makes keeping track of its problems more difficult.

Enemy Script
--------------
The enemy script controls everything that an enemy can do. In order for the enemy to change and reset 
I had to move it out of an enemy manager script and into one class. This is not good SoC.

============================================================

Postmortem:

If I could start over I would try and fix the SoC problems that I have.
I would want to keep things neat and only changing what they should be changing.
The code itself isn't that reusable since everything was designed specifically for unity.
So if I were to change the engine, then I would need to start from scratch and redo everything.
My code is some what maintainable. You can add more enemies since the Enemy script only changes 
the sprite. Weapons and other upgrades can be added since you just need to make another button to the weapon and
upgrade tabs. 

I didn't quite get to where I wanted to with the game. I wish there were more features that I could add
like weapons that change the hit box movement radius. There was actually the idea for abilities, but 
with the time I had left, that feature needed to be cut. The plan with abilities was to give the player 
a one hit attack for a small durration. Then the hitbox will have a smaller radius for a short time. With other
abilities.
